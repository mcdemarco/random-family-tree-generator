# The Official TODO List for the Project #

  * We've got CSV download; need CSV upload
  * "download" is actually cut-and-paste; add real CSV download
  * Add bloodline/spouse identification in HTML view
  * Some cultures are patriarchs, some matriachs; add seeding to handle both
  * Look up family tree to find "family names", to enable Henry the VIII...
  * Track inheritance of title to determine who holds the family name.
  * Add cousin-counting to determine how far away people are from "the line."

# The Bigger Official Feature TODO List for the Project #

  * We've got CSV download ... what about Upload for further tweaking?
  * Everyone marries a virgin ... seems unlikely.  Step-children make wonderful villains.
  * Got a request to have a cleaner way of showing the family tree.  Jquery UI maybe?
  * No direct heir?  What about adopting?
  * Might want to change whole mechanism for doing geneology:
    * If we did things year-by-year, we could adjust chances of marriage/death/birth/title based on who was actually alive at that moment... sure, you had two kids, but if they've passed, you're more eager to get remarried and have another heir.  etc.
  * Build a full repository (or allow for assigning a repository name) for families, so multiple family trees can be blended together
    * Family names need to be stored somewhere, or see AJAX idea below.
  * Add some AJAX for name generation, so more powerful logic and hang around elsewhere for coming up with names appropriate for the milieu.  I love typing milieu.  Milieu.  Mmmmm.
  * Possibly add some ethnicity tracking, when/if multiple families get
